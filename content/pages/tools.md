A variety of learning modules and simulators using Java® applets have been developed to simulate structural engineering and dynamics concepts.

[**Tuned Mass Damper**](/ans7870/1/1.561/tools/tmd/tmd.html)  
This simulation demonstrates the behavior of buildings when they are damped.

[**Ground Excitation of a Single Degree of Freedom Building**](/ans7870/1/1.561/tools/groundexcitation/shake.html)  
This simulation demonstrates the behavior of buildings under earthquake excitation.

[**Mass Shaker on the Same Building**](/ans7870/1/1.561/tools/massshaker/mshake.html)  
This simulation demonstrates the behavior of a building subjected to sinusoidal loading.

[**Motion Lab for Undergrads**](/ans7870/1/1.561/tools/motionlab/frameshake.html)  
This simulator demonstrates a building's behavior under dynamic loading. (Courtesy of Emma Shepherdson. Used with permission.)

**[Single Degree of Freedom Nonlinear Analysis Tool](http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?0405520)**  
This program was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It's very impressive and should be a useful tool. You can download the program onto your computer.
