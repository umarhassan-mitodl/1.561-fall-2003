### Examples of the Different Construction Materials

[1](#1): p94. Birs River Bridge at Liesberg, 1936. by Maillart. Detail from underside. Great view demonstrating maximum moments and primary secondary members. The column base spreads to load the foundation more evenly. The primary beam is haunched at the maximum moment over the support. It also allows it to have a smoother transition with the column.

[1](#1): p48. Salginatobel Bridge by Robert Maillart, 1930. A three pinned arch, at both the support hinges and the hinge at midspan can be seen. There is also a slight haunching of the deck beams at the cross wall supports.

[12](#12): p71. Pont du Gard near Nimes. An aqueduct built 63-13B.C., it had a road bridge running at the lower level added in 1747.

[12](#12): p92. Suspension Bridge over Min River, China made of fibre rope, 552m long.

[13](#13): Fig #13. Gatti-Wollspinnerei und -weberei, Rome, by Nervi 1951-53. Concrete Slab. Shows great use of concrete with floor beam structure almost having a form of principal stresses. The columns are also splayed at top to allow good integration and for punching shear.

[14](#14): p67. Segovia Aqueduct, first century A.D. Placements of stones show good load path as well as how the stone has been used in the past to it's best advantage - it is in compression.

[14](#14): p111. Sens Cathedral, c1145-1164.

[14](#14): p218. Westminster Hall, London, late 1300A.D. good example of old elaborate wood work, with well described load paths.

[15](#15): p184. Schlumberger Fabris Roof, Cambridge, England Tensile Roof of Cables and Membrane.

[15](#15): p40. National Recreation Centre, Crystal Palace, London. Stadium Roof. Steel Roof, with haunched beams. shows again a good load path can actually think about how it's working.

[16](#16): p183. The UNESCO Worshop on Natural Structures, Genoa, 1986. Internal view. Good "modern" timber usage, with roofing layout displaying the primary and secondary members.

[18](#18): one of the front plates and p121. Pavillion of the Future, Expo '92, Seville. Show modern possible uses of the similar stone... not just a "typical arch".

[25](#25): p6. Chefren Temple, Pillared Hall, 2400B.C. Shows how long stone has been around. how well formed it was back then and it's stong design. Design uses columns and beams with short spans as stone has low tensile strength.

[27](#27): 10.96, p106. Paper Church, by Shigaru Ban. It's paper! Well at least the columns are.

### Watching the Load Path through the Structures

[1](#1): p94. Birs River Bridge at Liesberg, 1936. by Maillart. Detail from underside. Great view demonstrating maximum moments and primary secondary members. The column base spreads to load the foundation more evenly. The primary beam is haunched at the maximum moment over the support. It also allows it to have a smoother transition with the column.

[2](#2): p257. First Exchange House, London, England 1989 Elevation showing the structural layout. Shows good load path - columns above arch are in compression, while those below are hangers in tension. The arch is in pure axial loading with some extra capacity to cope with extraneous bending moments. Lateral loads are carried by frame action in the structure above the arch and the primarily by the diagonal ties below the arch.

[2](#2): p295. Illustrations of the Effect of Out of Balance Loading on Suspension Roofs. Demonstrates the effects and then ways of overcoming them.

[3](#3): p297. Kuwait Chancery, Washington, D.C. 1982. Support system for Large Cantilever quite visible from truss and large corner columns. Interesting Structural system and form.

[8](#8): p129. The Bridge of the Firth of Forth, Scotland, 1889

[9](#9): p150. First Exchange House. (Bishopsgate Project, Broadgate) London, England 1989. Transfer Structure - see below.

[13](#13): Fig #1. Stadtisches Stadion, Florence, by Nervi 1930-32. Detail mit Treppe. Interesting form - curved beams support each other - can think about how they work and about torsion.

[13](#13): Fig #13. Gatti-Wollspinnerei und -weberei, Rome, by Nervi 1951-53. Concrete Slab. Shows great use of concrete with floor beam structure almost having a form of principal stresses. The columns are also splayed at top to allow good integration and for punching shear.

[13](#13): Fig #14. Salone delle Feste, Chianciano, by Nervi 1952. Decke des Festsaales. All concrete - beautiful dome - shows good support system with lines following "prinicpal" stress lines?

[13](#13): Fig #14. Palazzetto dello Sport, Rome, by Nervi 1956/57. Another roof similar to above - All concrete again showing good support system with lines following "prinicpal" stress lines?

[14](#14): p113. Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris. Cross-section illustrates the load paths- including the use of flying buttresses and arches and how they work....

[14](#14): p188. Westminster Hall, late 1300A.D. Roof Framing. Can see the load paths more clearly, including the role of each member and it's action.

[14](#14): p218. Westminster Hall, London, late 1300A.D. Good example of old elaborate wood work, with well described load paths.

[15](#15): p40. National Recreation Centre, Crystal Palace, London Stadium Roof. Steel Roof, with haunched beams. Shows again a good load path can actually think about how it's working.

[15](#15): p196. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Hong Kong, 1987. Good display of load path through building - use of hanger ties/truss action, and bending action of major column frames.

[16](#16): p95. Bari Stadium, Italy, 1987-90. Architectural Model of the Structure. Cross-sectional view allows the load path to be easily followed.

[16](#16): p183. The UNESCO Worshop on Natural Structures, Genoa, 1986. Internal view good "modern" timber usage, with roofing layout displaying the primary and secondary members.

[19](#19): p11. Julius Caesar's Bridge over the Rhine, drawn by A. Palladio. Very elementary structure - shows load paths well and can see what each element does.

[20](#20): p15. Hangar, Design II, by Nervi 1939. Good Barrel vault structure with clear load carrying elements and large buttress supports. Again all concrete.

[20](#20): p17. Salone B, Exposition Halls, Turin, by Nervi 1949. Interesting arched roof, with clear load path seen to columns from members.

[24](#24): p116. The Bridge of the Firth of Forth, Scotland, 1889. "A living model illustrating the structural principles".
